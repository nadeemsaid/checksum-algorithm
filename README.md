# checksum-algorithm

This project was created for the ECE 150 (Fundamentals of Programming) course at the University of Waterloo. It is an implementation of the WatNum checksum algorithm. The algorithm performs a series of calculations to the number at hand. The software can also verify the checksum algorithm and remove it as well.
